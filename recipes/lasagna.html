<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This chili dog mac and cheese combines two of my favorite things to eat—chili dogs and mac and cheese—and manages not to taste all that much like either one, while being wildly successful at being stupendously delicious.I can’t really explain why I decided to create this chili dog mac and cheese hybrid. I always get a few requests for comforting casseroles this time of year, but if the goal was to end up with a recipe that tasted like both things, I failed miserably. On the other hand, if a tasty, comforting casserole was the mission, then let’s celebrate…and invite a few friends, since this thing is huge.
